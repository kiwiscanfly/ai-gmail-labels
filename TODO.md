  - Ollama Python client for LLM integration
  - Google API client for Gmail integration
  - aiosqlite for database operations
  - MCP SDK for protocol implementation
  - Additional utilities (pydantic, structlog, tenacity)
- [x] Set up configuration management system (YAML + environment variables)
- [x] Create credentials handling and security manager

**Completed:**
- Created comprehensive pyproject.toml with all dependencies and development tools
- Implemented configuration management with Pydantic and YAML support
- Added environment variable override system
- Created custom exception hierarchy
- Built CLI interface with typer and rich for configuration management
- Updated project to use uv package manager for faster installs

### 3. Database and State Management âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Implement SQLite event bus system for agent communication
- [x] Create state manager with checkpoint functionality
- [x] Set up database schema for:
  - Message queue and event storage
  - User preferences and feedback
  - Conversation history
  - Performance metrics
- [x] Implement recovery mechanisms for interrupted workflows

**Completed:**
- SQLite-based event bus with async message publishing/subscription
- Message retry logic with priority and exponential backoff
- Workflow checkpoint system for state persistence and recovery
- User interaction and preference management
- Email processing queue with metadata storage
- Categorization feedback system for ML improvement
- Performance monitoring and statistics collection
- Automatic cleanup of old data with configurable retention
- WAL mode for better database concurrency
- CLI testing commands to verify database functionality

### 4. Core Service Integrations
- [ ] Create Ollama client with model management capabilities
- [ ] Implement Gmail API client with OAuth2 authentication
- [ ] Set up push notifications for real-time email monitoring
- [ ] Add rate limiting and quota management for API calls

## Phase 2: Agent Implementation (Medium Priority)

### 5. Orchestration Agent
- [ ] Implement LangGraph workflow with state management
- [ ] Create workflow nodes for email processing pipeline
- [ ] Add conditional routing based on confidence scores
- [ ] Implement checkpointing for workflow persistence

### 6. Specialized Agents
- [ ] **Email Retrieval Agent**: Fetch emails, handle pagination
- [ ] **Category Analysis Agent**: Analyze content using Ollama, calculate confidence
- [ ] **Gmail API Agent**: Apply labels, manage quotas, handle retries
- [ ] **User Interaction Agent**: Handle ambiguous cases through MCP

### 7. MCP Server Implementation
- [ ] Create MCP server with all required tools:
  - categorize_emails
  - list_uncategorized_emails
  - get_email_details
  - apply_label_to_email
  - get_categorization_stats
  - train_on_feedback
  - manage_labels
- [ ] Implement MCP resources for monitoring:
  - System status
  - Processing queue
  - Configuration
- [ ] Add interactive categorization handling

## Phase 3: Quality and Operations (Low Priority)

### 8. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling strategy
- [ ] Add circuit breakers for external service failures
- [ ] Create retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement workflow recovery from checkpoints

### 9. Performance and Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance monitoring with metrics collection
- [ ] Implement health checks for all system components
- [ ] Create logging strategy with structured JSON output
- [ ] Add memory and CPU usage monitoring

### 10. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for all agents and core components
- [ ] Create integration tests for Gmail API and Ollama
- [ ] Implement end-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] Add performance and load testing
- [ ] Security testing for authentication and data protection

### 11. Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Create Docker configuration for containerization
- [ ] Set up Claude Desktop MCP configuration
- [ ] Write deployment documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for MCP integration
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ documentation

## Priority Guidelines

**High Priority (Phase 1)**: Essential infrastructure that all other components depend on
- Project structure and dependencies
- Database and state management
- Core service integrations

**Medium Priority (Phase 2)**: Core functionality implementation
- Agent implementations
- MCP server and tools
- Workflow orchestration

**Low Priority (Phase 3)**: Quality, monitoring, and operational concerns
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance monitoring
- Testing and documentation

## Success Criteria

Each phase should meet the following criteria before proceeding to the next:

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All core services can be initialized successfully
- [ ] Database schema is created and functional
- [ ] OAuth2 authentication with Gmail works
- [ ] Ollama models can be loaded and queried

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] End-to-end email categorization workflow functions
- [ ] MCP server responds to all defined tools
- [ ] Interactive categorization works through MCP
- [ ] All agents communicate properly through event bus

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] System handles errors gracefully without crashing
- [ ] Performance metrics are collected and accessible
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum requirements (80%)
- [ ] Documentation is complete and deployment tested
